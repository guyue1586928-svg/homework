The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\\\\n\\\\nI do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\\\\n\\\\nThere was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency.\"}"

Because to get anywhere cool other than Downtown Chandler takes google-mapping and planning for drive-time and checking for construction on the 101, 60, 202, I rarely leave my 'hood. Sad. I know.\\n\\nI kept hearing about LGO from friends, coworkers and others who've apparently always dealt with driving everywhere and don't see this as a major pain in the ass. Poor souls just haven't lived where walking and public transportation are all you really need, and everything awesome is just a short walk or train ride away. My god, I miss NYC... but I digress.\\n\\nLGO.\\n\\nMy friend Monika and I planned to meet for breakfast at The Farm at South Mountain (yet another place to which I hadn't taken a \\\"road trip\\\" in these 3 years). When we got there, it was closed for summer. Oops. Guess we should've checked. Standing in the parking lot across the street, stomachs rumbling, beautiful morning... She says, \\\"Oh, how about La Grande Orange? I know you haven't been there, and you'll like it.\\\"\\n\\nMonika is a non-local local and knows everything about everywhere. She is one of the people who has most influenced my decisions on which places I've decided to go check out and she's always spot on with her recommendations. So LGO it was. She already had me out, and I had a full tank of gas. Let's drive. \\n\\nAnd drive we did (well, more than I like to, or am used to, but truly it was maybe 15-20 minutes from The Farm when all was said and done, on a Friday morning, after 8AM).\\n\\nWas it worth it? The food (at least this time around), not so much, but the overall experience, definitely.  The breakfast I ordered wasn't \\\"oh-my-god-the-best-egg-white-omelet-i've-ever-had\\\" but it was good. It was also the first egg white omelet I ever get that is not covered in oil, isn't huge, and isn't overstuffed. It was a normal portion, for a normal person, with an average appetite. It's called the Daybreaker: egg whites (they come like that, it isn't an extra $1.50 like it is at some places), turkey, and a tomato-avocado salsa. \\n\\nI tend to order healthier breakfasts, though I always fantasize about the pancakes or waffles. If I can share those with someone, then I'm game, but I know Monika and I both tend to sit on the \\\"healthy\\\" side of things, so I didn't even suggest it. She ordered eggs, toast and jam. Pretty simple breakfast, but again, very normal sized portions, nothing looked shiny with oil. \\n\\nI know you all were probably hoping I'd dish out rave reviews about something else, like the pastries in the case, or their breads... I promise  I'll return, and I will indulge in something other than egg whites, in the name of Yelping.  But truly, my fairly-priced Daybreaker omelet was good - not great. The tomato-avocado salsa truly gave it that \\\"mmm\\\".\\n\\nI also noticed on the sandwich menu that they have a Cuban sandwich, aptly named Cubano. Not so sure it'll taste authentic, but I'm not a Cuban food snob, and if some non-Cubans are giving it an honest try, even putting their own spin on it, I'll try it. And I'll probably love it (or at least like it a lot). You can't go wrong with a Cuban sandwich, especially one whose special spin is Gruyere cheese and spicy brown mustard. I'll let you know. Promise. \\n\\nThey have sushi (which I won't eat, ever, anywhere, any kind), salads, and some other breakfasts - egg dishes, yogurt/granola, oatmeal, burrito, etc. Nothing that really calls to me. So I'll likely just return for the Cuban sandwich and pastries.\\n\\nIt wasn't really the food that was good about this place. More than the food, I just loved the environment. Yes, there were people having conversations on a phone or with another person. People on laptops. Some tourists. So what? Live and let live, you know? \\n\\nWe spent 15 minutes eating and then 2 hours perusing the shop/market. They've got some unusual items, gourmet/specialty candy, ingredients, mixes and other foods, some really neat gifts for people and pets and some awesome art. Not sure how often or what kind of variety they carry. When I went they had these really interesting vases, one-of-a-kind, with things written on them. They were funny, or twisted (or both), and totally thought-provoking. The artist is Kaelyn Loes. I may pick up one or two for some good friends who I know appreciate \\\"word art.\\\"\\n\\nAs for parking - it sucks, but we got lucky. The parking lot is across the street and tiny, and I can see this being a problem. In fact, others' reviews mention that too. I read somewhere that the designer for LGO did this on purpose to encourage foot traffic and make this place a \\\"community\\\" gathering spot for the area locals, so I appreciate the concept. and you won't find me bitching about the parking situation. \\n\\nFinal word? If you live in the valley, go at least once. It's not like any of the boring, personality-lacking chain places at every strip mall. A diversion from the predictable crap on every corner in suburbia.</td>\n",
